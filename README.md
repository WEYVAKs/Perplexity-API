--header 'x-rapidapi-key: YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY' \
--header 'x-rapidapi-host: perplexity2.p.rapidapi.com' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{

### Python (using `requests`)

```python
import requests
import json

url = "[https://perplexity2.p.rapidapi.com/perplexity](https://perplexity2.p.rapidapi.com/perplexity)"

payload = {
    "content": "What is today's news in America?"
}

    "x-rapidapi-host": "perplexity2.p.rapidapi.com",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print(json.dumps(data, indent=4))
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
    print(response.text)

```

### JavaScript (using `fetch`)

```javascript
const url = '[https://perplexity2.p.rapidapi.com/perplexity](https://perplexity2.p.rapidapi.com/perplexity)';

const options = {

        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
        }
        const result = await response.json();
        console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 4));
